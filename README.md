Does GitHub show that both partners contributed substantially to the code?
  - Yes.
  - Note: say something about what you're changing in your commit messages. Things like "changes" or "push" or "assignment" aren't very informative.

Does the page allow a poll to be created with one question and multiple answers?
  - Yes.

After the poll has been created, does the page allow votes to be cast?
  - Yes.

After votes have been cast, does the page allow them to be tallied?
  - Yes.

Is the user interface intuitive and easy to use?
  - It would be nice if the input boxes were longer so they could show more text at a time.
  - It would be nice if the winning result were highlighted in some way.

Is the page tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
  - Yes.
